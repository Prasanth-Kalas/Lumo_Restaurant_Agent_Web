/**
 * GET /api/health
 *
 * Polled by the shell every HEALTH_POLL_MS (default 10s). The payload
 * feeds the rolling score that drives the circuit breaker — so keep
 * this cheap. Never hit OpenTable from here on the happy path; only
 * report cached upstream status.
 *
 * Status conventions (defined in @orchet/agent-sdk/health):
 *   - "ok"       → HTTP 200, all upstreams healthy, within SLA
 *   - "degraded" → HTTP 200, we can serve but something is wobbly
 *                  (e.g. OpenTable latency elevated, partner quota low)
 *   - "down"     → HTTP 503, we cannot serve; circuit breaker opens
